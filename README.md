# My Ansible Playbooks

It should be simple to install whatever you use in your daily basis, right?
So, you should just run the command below and grab a coffee:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matheusfig90/ansible-playbooks/master/install.sh --output install.sh
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Enjoy it ;)
